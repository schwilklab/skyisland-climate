# data-cache.R

# provides the get_data() function that allows efficient laoding of data that
# is time-consuming to read from disk and trabsform or clean. We have several
# data sources (ascii gis grids, iButton time series, etc) which take
# considerable porcessing time to laod and transform to a useful format. But
# wwe also only want to store the raw data and code in git, not the
# intermediate useful forms. So the solution is to store the intermediate forms
# as .rds objects in a directory ignored by git. Then if those rds files do not
# exist already (and, optionally, if the source data is newer than the rds
# files), the code will rerun the reading and transforming. If the rds files
# exst and are new enough, the function simply returns the loaded R object.
